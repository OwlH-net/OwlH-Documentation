OwlH API
========

The OwlH API is an open source **RESTful API** that allows for interaction with the ``OwlH Master`` and ``OwlH Node`` components from a web browser, command line tool like cURL or any script or program that can make web requests. The OwlH UI and APP relies on this totally. Use the API to easily perform everyday actions like adding a node, restarting the services or looking up status details.
