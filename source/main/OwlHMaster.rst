What is OwlH Master?
--------------------

This is a single box appliance running OwlH Master and usually OwlH UI. 
OwlH Master is a REST API that centralize all the management capabilities.
There is no limit on the OwlH Nodes number an OwlH Master can manage. 

How does it work? 
-----------------

After nodes are registered you will be able to configure things like listening interfaces, rulesets deployed on each node. 

By default all connections are started from master to nodes. As a centralized point of management, it also allows you to collect traffic from remote nodes o listen a local interface to save information in PCAP format and distribute it between different nodes.
