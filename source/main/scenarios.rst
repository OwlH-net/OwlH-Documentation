What's your need?
=================


What do you want to achieve with NIDS platform in your Network?

BASIC
-----

  * Monitor a single server traffic
  * Monitor traffic from one or multiple network segments using a SPAN/Mirror Port

ADVANCED
--------

  * I have some remote/cloud servers but I can't use SPAN/Mirror facilities and I need to monitor server's traffic
  * Transport traffic from remote servers in cloud environment for analysis, storage and forensic
  * We have an hybrid cloud (AWS, Google Cloud, AZURE) and on-premises environment and need a centralized NIDS management and security view

INTEGRATE WITH WAZUH
--------------------

  * Just sent default Suricata alerts to Wazuh-ELK
  * Unify Suricata and Zeek outputs, send to Wazuh-ELK and visualize with some cool dashboard
